The article on Metabolic Roles of Uncultivaded Bacterioplankton Lineages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico 'Dead Zone' wass published on September 12 2017. 

In this study they had sampled bacteria thriving in oxic and hypoxic conditions and studied their RNA expression profile to determine the metabolic potential of the marine organisms. 

The project is aimed to analyse the subset of the sequence data generated for DNA and RNA under varying oxygen pressures.
